  # If a service has "disabled:true", it's currently turned off. 
  #
  # Some services require local api key or connection details as config.
  # Most services take other options for custom configuration too, not
  # all options are neccesarily listed as examples here, see source
  # or source-generated docs for more info.   

  # The services in the 'default' group are loaded every time. 
  # You can optionally create other groups of services, that can be loaded
  # by URL query params, or based on other request params. More info?
