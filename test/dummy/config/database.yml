# UMLAUT: mysql db with mysql2 adapter strongly recommended for Umlaut, in both 
# production and development. sqlite3 has unclear semantics under threaded 
# concurrency which umlaut uses, and in many cases simply does not work. 
#
# A higher pool size than ordinary is recommended because of umlaut's
# use of concurrency. Perhaps as large as the number of services
# you have configured to run in the same wave, plus another few.
